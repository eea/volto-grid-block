# volto-tabs-block

[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/eea/volto-tabs-block)](https://github.com/eea/volto-tabs-block/releases)

This addon enables ad-hoc grouping of Volto blocks under sections and tabs. It needs to run with the [Form State Context PR](https://github.com/plone/volto/pull/1711) from Volto. It introduces a "tabs block" which can be used, from the Edit form, to switch between the visible blocks of that tab page. This is achieved by manipulating the form context blocks_layout from the tabs block, made possible once the Form state is exposed as a context. In View mode it manipulates the visible content on the page through changes in the `content` global state reducer.
